#Dartboard Game

This game will ask for different inputs. 
##Note that all points should be input as fractions
1. There will be two points used to create a rectangular dartboard. The user input will be the corner opposite of (0,0)
2. The user should then input how many polygons they would like inside the dartboard. This will be used to calculate the score - if a dart lands in this spot, the player's
score will increase
3. The following lines will include how many vertices the polygon has as well as the vertices input as points
4. Once finished, the player will input how many darts they would like to throw as a whole number
5. Finally, they will continue to enter points where they would like the dart to land until they have thrown as many darts as previously entered
